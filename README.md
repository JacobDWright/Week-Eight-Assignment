# Week-Eight-Assignment
Week Eight Labs



Lab One

Part One:  
To do this lab, you will be modifying the code in **index.html**  Don't panic. You are not touching any of the HTML code, only the Python part of it.  Here is what to do:  

Look inside the index.html file. Inside it, at about line 50, you will see python code that starts with:  

	import turtle   
	t = turtle.Turtle()  
      
Right below those two lines is where you will insert your python code.



Write a program that does the following:  

1. Prompt the user for the desired number of sides for a polygon.   
2. Draw the polygon.  

Hints:The interior angle of a regular polygon is ( (sides− 2)×180)/sides.  
Remember to subtract that angle from 180


Optional: prompt for a color and color the interior of your polygon.


Submit your python code in the dropbox.
